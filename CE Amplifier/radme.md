# CE Amplifier PCB Design
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Common Emitter (CE) Amplifier circuit using Proteus software. 
The project includes the schematic, PCB layout, and 3D view of the design.

## Features
  - Schematic Design: Detailed circuit diagram of the CE Amplifier.
  - PCB Layout: High-quality PCB design with optimized routing.
  - 3D View: Realistic 3D visualization of the PCB design.

### Tools Used
  - Proteus Design Suite: For creating the schematic, PCB layout, and 3D view.

### Project Components
  - Resistors (R1, R2, R3, R4)
  - Capacitors (C1, C2, C3)
  - Transistor (Q1)
  - Power supply and other essential components

### How to Use
  - Open the project files in Proteus software.
  - Simulate the schematic to analyze the working of the CE Amplifier circuit.
  - Review the PCB layout for component placement and routing.
  - Visualize the design in 3D view to better understand the PCB structure.

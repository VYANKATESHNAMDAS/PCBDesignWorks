# 4-Bit Shift Register Project

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a 4-bit shift register using Proteus software. 
The project includes a PCB layout, schematic, 3D view, and necessary details for understanding and reproducing the design.

## Project Description

A 4-bit shift register is a sequential logic circuit widely used in digital systems for data storage and transfer. 
This project focuses on creating a functional 4-bit shift register circuit with LEDs to visualize the shifting process.

### Features

  - Switch Inputs (DSW1, DSW2): Used to input binary data to the shift register.

  - Resistors (R1-R4): Current-limiting resistors for the LEDs.

  - LEDs (D1-D4): Indicate the state of each bit in the shift register.

  - Clock Input (CLK): Drives the shift operation.

  - Power Supply: Provides the necessary power for the circuit.

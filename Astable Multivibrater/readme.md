# Astable Multivibrator Project
This project demonstrates an Astable Multivibrator designed and simulated using Proteus software.
The project includes a complete circuit schematic, PCB design, and a 3D view for better visualization of the hardware implementation.

## Features
  - Circuit simulation using Proteus.
  - PCB design for hardware implementation.
  - 3D view of the PCB to visualize the final hardware.

## Software Used
  - Proteus Design Suite: For schematic, simulation, and PCB design.

### Components Required
  - 1] 555 Timer IC
  - 2] Resistors (R1, R2)
  - 3] Capacitors (C1, C2)
  - 4] LED
  - 5] Battery or DC power supply
  - 6] Connecting wires

### Circuit Description
The 555 Timer IC is configured in the astable mode, where the timing components (resistors R1, R2, and capacitor C1) determine the frequency and duty cycle of the output waveform. 
The circuit generates a square wave output that drives an LED, causing it to blink.


### How to Run the Simulation
  - Open the Proteus project file (.pdsprj).
  - Run the simulation to observe the blinking LED.
  - Analyze the waveforms at the output pin of the 555 Timer IC.

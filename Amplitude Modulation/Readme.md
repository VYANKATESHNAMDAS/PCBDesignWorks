# Amplitude Modulation Circuit Design

This project demonstrates the design and implementation of an Amplitude Modulation (AM) circuit using Proteus software.
The project includes the schematic, PCB layout, and a 3D view for better understanding and visualization.

## Project Overview
Amplitude Modulation (AM) is a method of transmitting signals by varying the amplitude of a carrier wave in proportion to the information signal. 

### This project focuses on designing a basic AM circuit with the following features:
  - Schematic Design: Detailed circuit design of the AM modulator.

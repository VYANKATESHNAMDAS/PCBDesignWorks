## 1] Full-Wave Rectifier
This repository contains files and documentation for a Full-Wave Rectifier circuit, including its schematic, PCB layout, and 3D model.

## Project Overview
A Full-Wave Rectifier is an electronic circuit that converts an alternating current (AC) input into a direct current (DC) output. 
This circuit uses diodes to achieve full-wave rectification, which allows current flow in both directions, providing a more efficient DC output compared to a half-wave rectifier.

### Repository Structure

/schematic: Contains the circuit schematic for the Full-Wave Rectifier.

/pcb_design: Contains the PCB design files (Gerber files, etc.) for the rectifier.

/3d_view: Contains 3D model views of the PCB for visual reference.
